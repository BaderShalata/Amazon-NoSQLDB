# Amazon-NoSQLDB
Theme was that Amazone has decided to expand its operations by delivering fresh groceries. Amazone partnered with Morrizon, a UK grocery retailer, to offer same-day and instant grocery delivery service. Amazone has decided to experiment with same-day and instant grocery delivery using Manchester. Six Morrizon grocery stores have been chosen for instant pick-up and delivery by delivery drivers who are Amazon partners. 

Our groupâ€™s task is to design the database (Collection Relation Diagram), implement and demonstrate a NoSQL database using MongoDB for the Amazone online shopping website that operates only in the UK.

We queried the database using mixtures of Aggregation pipelines MongoDB and Python
We then recorded a 20 minutes video explaining our design choices, patterns and queries. 

Lastly, individually, we reported on any replication and partition strategies if the company decides to expand to other EU branches.
